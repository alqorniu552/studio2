# **App Name**: ContainerPilot

## Core Features:

- Container List: Display a list of active containers with their name, port mappings, and access instructions.
- Container Creation: Allow users to create new containers by specifying a client name and other optional parameters. If no port is specified, an open port must be located and used for creating the container.
- Port Management: Automate port mapping for each client container to ensure unique access points on the host server.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark indigo (#4B0082) to convey stability and control.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and modern appearance.
- Use simple, consistent icons to represent different container states (running, stopped, etc.) and actions (create, delete, restart).
- Design a clear and intuitive layout with a sidebar navigation and a main content area for managing containers.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance the user experience when creating or modifying containers.
